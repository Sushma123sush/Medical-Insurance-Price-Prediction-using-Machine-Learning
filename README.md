# Medical-Insurance-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Medical insurance pricing is a multifaceted process influenced by various personal and lifestyle factors. This 
project explores the use of machine learning, specifically linear regression, to predict individual medical 
insurance costs based on attributes such as age, gender, BMI (calculated using height and weight), number of 
children, smoking habits, and residential region. A public dataset is utilized to train and evaluate the model, 
allowing for a practical implementation that reflects real-world conditions. To make the solution accessible to 
users with minimal technical background, a user-friendly interface has been developed using Streamlit. The 
application enables users to enter their personal information and receive a cost estimate in Indian Rupees 
(INR), offering insights into how lifestyle choices impact healthcare expenses. This project demonstrates the 
power of data analytics in simplifying financial planning for health-related decisions and enhances awareness 
regarding the economic implications of personal health behaviors.
